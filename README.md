# cheapbot
A Python bot which uses [skinport.py](https://github.com/PaxxPatriot/skinport.py) and [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) to send new listings on Skinport, which are the cheapest to a Discord Webhook URL.

Usage
-----

The [release package](https://github.com/PaxxPatriot/cheapbot/releases) comes with embedded Python so you don't have to install anything. Just simply put your Discord Webhook URL in the `config.py` file and you are good to go.
To find out how to create a Webhook to a Discord channel you can read this [support article](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks).
